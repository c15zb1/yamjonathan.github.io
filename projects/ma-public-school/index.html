              <h3 class="mb-0">Success often starts with quality education (and good data)</h3>
              <p>In 2013, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts public school system was comprised of <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Public_education_in_Massachusetts#cite_note-1" target="_blank">1,854 schools for 954,773 students</a>, supported by an average per-pupil spending of <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Public_education_in_Massachusetts#cite_note-2" target="_blank">$14,515</a>. With the aim of continually improving the quality and accessibility of public education, the Commonwealth has introduced a variety of Non-Traditional public school models. The growing prevalence of Charter Schools, Exam Schools, Pilot Schools, and other Non-Traditional public schools coupled with ongoing education reform at all levels of administration makes management of the school system a complex and expensive process.</p>

              <h3 class="mb-0">How do we measure quality of education?</h3>
              <p>This answer varies depending on the scope of the problem. At the student level, standardized testing and graduation rates are some obvious metrics. However, the measures of educational quality become more and more complex as we scope out to the public school system of 1,854 schools as a whole.</p>
              <p>For the Commonwealth's interests, the quality of the school system needs to measured at almost every level of scope. To facilitate accountability at all levels of the education system (from individual teacher assessments to district-level financial reports) and to decide how to best invest the education budget, the <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/DataAccountability.html" target="_blank">Department of Elementary and Secondary Education</a> systematically assesses many aspects of each public school. Every year, this wealth of data detailing finances, demographics, grades/exam outcomes, graduation/college enrollment outcomes, and much more, all of which are published publicly.</p>

              <p>The Commonwealth has supported Public School models that are afforded special autonomy and regulations that are different than that of Traditional Public Schools.

          <p>The datasets that we've gathered are chock full of information, and we need to pare it down to the information that's relevant to our objective and sort it by individual school. Unfortunately, the datasets are not immediately ready to analyze!</p>

          <!--<p>Firstly, we need to join the datasets by individual school, since we are interested in school level characteristics. Since some of our datasets are of District level resolution (e.g. Per-Pupil Spending), we need to find a way to join them with the School level resolution datasets properly. By decomposing from the Organization Code identifier, an 8 digit numeric that specifies the District and School, we can do this.</p>-->
          <h3 class="mb-0">Directory Information</h3>
          <p>The datasets from the Statewide Report don't contain all of the school characteristics that could be useful. <a href="http://profiles.doe.mass.edu/search/search.aspx?leftNavId=11238" target="_blank"> Directory datasets</a> provide information such as the School Name, School Type (e.g. Charter), Title 1 Status, and Address, that we will need.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-0">Missing Data</h3>
      	  <p>After joining our datasets and selecting all of the public high schools, we encounter sparsity that needs to be addressed:</p>
          	<ul>
	         	<li>Financial Info: Many schools did not report expenditure or salary data</li>
	         	<li>AP Performance: A large number of schools did not report scores</li>
	         	<li>SAT Performance: A small number of schools did not report scores</li>
	         	<li>MCAS Performance: A large number of schools did not report scores</li>
	        </ul> 			
          </p>

          <h3 class="mb-0">School Type</h3>
          <p class="mb-0">Some of this missing data actually occurs non-randomly! The Commonwealth's <a href="http://www.doe.mass.edu/lawsregs/statelaws.html" target="_blank"> Education Laws and Regulations</a> contains provisions that govern whether or not each school is required to report financial data or administer/report Exams, and the reporting requirements for our missing data are actually differential with respect to School Type. We'll want to pay special attention to the effect of School Type on outcomes in our analysis.</p>

          <h2 class="mb-3">Exploration</h2>

          <p>Let's start generating very basic summaries of our data to see if anything stands out.</p>

          <h3 class="mb-0">Schools and Districts</h3>
          <p>Excluding Alternative and Vocational Technical schools, Massachusetts enrolled <b>58,135 grade 12 students</b> in the 2014-2015 academic year across <b>292 Public High Schools in 254 Districts</b>. In the Boston district, which had an annual net expenditure of $911,415,109, there were 25 Public High Schools in the district. In contrast, the median district annual net expenditure was $35,729,039.</p>
          <p>There were <b>5 Types of schools</b> as defined under the Education Laws and Regulations:
      	    <ul>
	         	<li>248 Traditional Public Schools</li>
	         	<li>27 Charter Public Schools</li>
	         	<li>7 Public Pilot Schools</li>
	         	<li>6 Public International Baccalaureate (IB) Schools</li>
	         	<li>4 Public Exam Schools</li>
	        </ul>
	      </p>

	      <h3 class="mb-0">Economic Disadvantage</h3>
          <p>The prevalence of Economic Disadvantage among all Public Schools ranges widely from 2.0% to 65.6%, with a median of 21.3%. Non-Traditional Schools tend to enroll a greater proportion of Disadvantaged students than the Traditional Schools do.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" width="500" height="250" src="img/histogram_disadvantage_overall.png" alt="">
      	  <p></p>

	      <h3 class="mb-0">Graduation</h3>
          <p>The average graduation rate among all of the schools was <b>89.1%</b>.</p>
      	  <p>Among the graduates of every school, an average of <b>59.4% went on to attend a 4-year college</b> within 16 months of graduation and an average of <b>20.0% went on to attend a 2-year college</b> within 16 months of graduation, totalling nearly 80%.</p>
      	  <p>In contrast, among the graduates of every school where the prevalence of Economic Disadvantage was above the median, only an average of <b>47.5% went on to attend a 4-year college</b>.</p>
      	  <img class="img-fluid" width="500" height="250" src="img/table_college_type.png" alt="">
      	  <br><br>
      	  <p>When stratified by School Type, however, it becomes apparent that college enrollment is not independent of the School Type. Interestingly, we see that the Public Exam Schools and Charter Schools send more graduates to college than Traditional Schools do, but the IB Schools and Pilot Schools send less.</p>

	      <h3 class="mb-0">SAT and MCAS Performance</h3>
          <p>As we would expect, SAT Scores are highly correlated with Four Year College Enrollment, although the residuals do tend upward in the lower SAT Scores. </p>
          <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="600" src="img/lm_sat_college.png" alt="">
          <br>
          <p>Interestingly, they also appear collinear.</p>
          <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="600" src="img/lm_sat_sat.png" alt="">

      	  <p>The MCAS Scores are also highly correlated with Four Year College Enrollment. At a glance, the relationships look more homoscedastic. Note the markedly higher intercept for the Science and Technology subject.</p>
      	  <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="600" src="img/lm_mcas_college.png" alt="">
      	  <br>
      	  <p>The collinearity is not as strong as in the SAT measure.</p>

        <div class="my-auto">
          <h2 class="mb-3">Analysis</h2>

          <p>Let's try to fit a model to our data. Our included variables will be:
            <ul>
	         	<li>Four Year College Enrollment (the response)</li>
	         	<li>Economically Disadvantaged Status</li>
	         	<li>English Language Learner Status</li>
	         	<li>Net Spending by District</li>
	         	<li>Per-Pupil Spending by District</li>
	         	<li>Teacher Salary</li>
	         	<li>SAT Math Performance</li>
	         	<li>AP Aggregate Performance</li>
	        </ul>
	        We've reduced our "Exam Performances" measure dimensions down to just SAT Math and AP Aggregate, since we observed collinearity between the SAT Performance measures and between the MCAS Performance measures. The AP Performance data was fairly sparse depending on the specific Subject, so we will use the Aggregate measure, which was a lot more complete and still captures some information from the Subject data that we've excluded.
          </p>
          <h3 class="mb-0">Correlation Plot</h3>
          <img class="img-fluid" width="650" height="500" src="img/corr_full.png" alt="">

          <p>As we've already observed, there is strong correlation between schools' standardized exam performance and Four-Year College Enrollment of their graduates.</p>

      	  <p>What we did not originally see, though, is that schools' prevalence of Economically Disadvantaged students is also highly correlated. In examing the temporality of Disadvantaged Status and the Exam measures, students' economic disadvantage most likely precedes Exams, which precede college enrollment. This should make it a good predictor for our initial model:</p>

      	  <h3 class="mb-3">Simple Linear Regression Model</h3>
      	  <img class="img-fluid" width="650" height="500" src="img/lm_disadvantage_initial.png" alt="">
      	   <br> <br>
      	  <p>The simple linear regression model produces a fit with an <b>adjusted R-squared statistic of 0.5353</b>. A simple interpretation would be that increased prevalence of Economically Disadvantage status is associated with decreased Four-Year College enrollment. However, noticing that the average <b>residuals tend upward as the predictor increases</b> despite the right skew, we need to investigate the extreme values. </p>

      	  <p>As it turns out, <b>the 15 most positive residual values all come from Non-Traditional schools</b>, while <b>all but one of the 15 most negative residual values come from Traditional schools</b>.</p>
      	  <p>Now, let's try to fit the same model with Traditional Public Schools only.</p>

      	  <img class="img-fluid" width="650" height="500" src="img/lm_disadvantage_initial_public_only.png" alt="">
      	   <br> <br>
      	  <p>The fit is greatly improved after excluding Non-Traditional Schools, with an <b>adjusted R-squared statistic of 0.728</b>. If we take another look at our initial model and distinguish the Type of schools, then we should be able to observe why this improvement occured.</p>

      	  <h3 class="mb-3">Visualizing the Model by School Type</h3>
      	  <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="500" src="img/lm_disadvantage_initial_type.png" alt="">
		  <p>Here are the mean residuals by Type:</p>
      	  <p><img class="img-fluid" width="350" height="180" src="img/table_residual_type.png" alt=""></p>
      	  <p>Some valuable insights can be drawn here: 
      	  	<ul>
      	  		<li>Traditional Public Schools with low prevalence of Economic Disadvantage (see the grouping where Economic Disadvantage prevalence <10%) produce some of the greatest proportions of graduates who will enroll into Four-Year Colleges. The response in this cluser of Public Schools has small variance.</li>
      	  		<li>Compared to Traditional Public Schools with similar prevalence of Economic Disadvantage, the Non-Traditional Public Schools produce a greater proportion of graduates who will enroll into Four-Year Colleges overall, at the cost of more variance.</li>
      	  		<li>Compared to Traditional Public Schools with low prevalence of Economic Disadvantage, almost all Non-Traditional Public Schools produce a smaller proportion of graduates who will enroll into Four-Year Colleges, with exception of the Public Exam Schools.</li>
      	  	</ul>	
      	  </p>

		  
		  <h3 class="mb-3">Refining the Model</h3>
		  <p>Based on our analysis, the model estimates the Four-Year College Enrollment of traditional Public Schools quite well, but drastically underestimates the Four-Year College Enrollment of the non-traditional schools.</p>
		  <p>We will create an adjusted predictor value that will regularize only the Non-Traditional Schools Economic Disadvantage value towards the minimum.</p>
		  <img class="img-fluid" width="800" height="500" src="img/lm_disadvantage_refined_type.png" alt="">
		  <p>The refined model using the adjusted predictor variable produces a fit with an <b>adjusted R-squared statistic of 0.6621</b>, a big improvement over the inital model's adjusted R-squared of 0.5353.</p>

          <ul class="fa-ul mb-0">
          	<p>In these datasets, "Economically Disadvantaged" students are those who participate in any of these four state-administered programs:
          	  <ul>
          		<li>Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)</li>	
          		<li>Transitional Assistance for Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC)</li>
          		<li>Department of Children and Families' (DCF) Foster Care Program</li>
          		<li>MassHealth (Medicaid)</li>
          	  </ul>
          	</p>
          	<p>Every school Type observes reduced Four-Year College Enrollment with increased Economic Disadvantage.</p>
          	<p>All of the Traditional Public Schools with low prevalence of Economic Disadvantage send a very high proportion of their graduates to Four-Year Colleges.</p>
          	<p>Non-Traditional Public Schools vary greatly in their Four-Year College Enrollment, but often perform better than Traditional Public Schools that have similar Economic Disadvantage.</p>
